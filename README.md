## User List React App - Development Environment

â†’ The development environment is where software developers create, modify, test, and refine code to meet the project requirements and specifications.

They also have access to a range of tools and resources to facilitate their work such as version control, debugging tools, and testing frameworks.

### To start development environment, run this command

```bash
$ yarn dev
